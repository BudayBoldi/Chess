# Its Chess, but in my way.

Your goal is to kill 16 soldiers (basicly a whole army) to get the big win.
You can also kill your soldiers to achieve your goal.

The pawns are stronger, they can jump.
The bishop, can also jump (or hop xD).
The horse can kill in square formations.
The rook has 2 life.
The king has godmode.
The queen has one move, but she has to be the last one standing.
